## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I am a curious and versatile individual passionate about innovation, combining creative, analytical, and communicative skills. I learn by doing, as evidenced by my projects like Resumenes.org ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20151017093140/http://resumenes.org/)), YouShare.TV ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20180419095104/https://youshare.tv/)), criptowiki, and BitcoinArgy.

### Current Projects
In 2019, I created [criptowiki](https://criptowiki.com) to share authentic and practical knowledge about Bitcoin and privacy-enhancing technologies to help protect liberty, during a time when many doubted Bitcoin's future. In 2023, I created [BitcoinArgy.com](https://bitcoinargy.com), a news aggregator to stay updated on industry trends and free from the biases of social networks.

### Formal Education
I am completing a [BBA (~97%)](https://www.itba.edu.ar/grado/licenciatura-en-negocios-y-tecnologia/).

### Hands-On Learning
I am actively enhancing my skills through online courses on [Codecademy](https://github.com/martinmorando/martinmorando/blob/main/courses.md) and the [fastai course](https://course.fast.ai/) on deep learning. I enjoy exploring and learning, especially in an informal way, free from restrictive, irrational rules and whims of authoritarian and pessimistic teachers, and I take notes and experiment to consolidate my understanding, which you might find useful: [Applied AI](https://github.com/martinmorando/applied-ai), [Bash](https://github.com/martinmorando/bash), [C++](https://github.com/martinmorando/cpp), [DSA](https://github.com/martinmorando/dsa), [Golang](https://github.com/martinmorando/golang), [HTML/CSS](https://github.com/martinmorando/htmlcss), [Java](https://github.com/martinmorando/java), [JavaScript](https://github.com/martinmorando/js), [LOLCODE](https://github.com/martinmorando/lolcode), [Lua](https://github.com/martinmorando/lua), [PHP](https://github.com/martinmorando/php), [Python](https://github.com/martinmorando/python), [R](https://github.com/martinmorando/r), [Ruby](https://github.com/martinmorando/ruby), [SQL](https://github.com/martinmorando/sql).
